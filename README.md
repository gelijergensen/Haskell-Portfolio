# FingerTrees 
![status badge](https://github.com/gelijergensen/FingerTrees/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)

An implementation of 2-3 finger trees Ã  la [Hinze &amp; Paterson 2006](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.pdf), including several applications.


This project falls into the category of Purely Functional Data Structures.
It consists of the implementation of a general abstract data structure (namely 2-3 finger trees in the style of Hinze & Paterson) along with the application to five data structures including deques, sets, and ordered sequences.
Each of the five data structures has a rich interface and we include details on the complexity of each of the methods of the data structures.

Please see the [FingerTrees README](https://github.com/gelijergensen/FingerTrees) for more details.

# MetaLogic
![status badge](https://github.com/gelijergensen/MetaLogic/actions/workflows/haskell.yml/badge.svg)

A simple calculator for general logic systems.

This project falls into the category of Math and Logic.
It consists of the abstract definition of a logic system and the implementation of four different logic systems including classical and intuitionistic propositional logic.
Additionally, the project contains a small interactive calculator which allows for user input of formulas and stepwise reduction of formulas in each of the four logic systems.

Please see the [MetaLogic README](https://github.com/gelijergensen/MetaLogic) for more details.
