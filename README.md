# Haskell-Portfolio
A small portfolio of three projects written in Haskell.

# FingerTrees

An implementation of 2-3 finger trees Ã  la [Hinze &amp; Paterson 2006](https://www.staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.pdf), including several applications.

The project consists of the implementation of several purely functional data structures, each of which builds upon the same underlying abstract structure.
Please see the [FingerTrees README](FingerTrees/README.md) for more details.
